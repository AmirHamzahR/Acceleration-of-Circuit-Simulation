- keep trying different circuit, document it, LTSPice, 
until reach the limit 

- add in inductors (as low priority)

- see if can model transistor as 3 port or 4 port, can use
lookup table get the IV curves, can do piecewise linear,
plot in IV curve, important the 3 port integrate circuit,
submatrix (important)

- use armadillo, convert python to C++, see how Jacobian works,
don't change the algorithm, armadillo is already accelerating, run
it on multiple core (for CPU, GPU maybe) (important)

- for FPGA, use VItisAI

1) Modify code for multiple cores in CPU

2) Then, modify for multiple cores in GPU

- run multiple simulation on each core, different statistical variation
- condition to parallelize it
- check profilers in Linux (checks how much cache are you using)
- DDr memory, bottleneck

3) Make a graph with total nodes, C++ and Python
