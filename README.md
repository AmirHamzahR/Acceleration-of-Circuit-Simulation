# Acceleration-of-Circuit-Simulation
An MEng project which tests out how far softwares and hardware could go along together in achieving the best performance benchmarks. In this case, the circuit simulation performance benchmarks are used as more complex circuits is used in the industry which makes computing resources in simulating them scarce. The main method in simulating these circuits is by using LU decomposition for the sparse matrices from the circuit variables. The language that are used for this programme is mainly Python, MATLAB, and C++. Most of the research work has been written done in the daybook loggings markdown file.
