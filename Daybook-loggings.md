# Developer's Logging for project's Daybook

## 21/9/2022

Today, I have learned and researched a few KLU libraries that would be useful to be used for the overall project. I have also asked my supervisor if the KLU libraries that
were discovered would be a good resource for the project.

Some resources from [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) was studied more thoroughly to improve my understandings on the latest C++ 20. Currently, I was trying to understand more how scope, duration and linkages work in the C++20 syntax. One important thing that was gained is that the nesting's maximum level should always be 3 for compound statements.

I continued learning more on [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) for declarations and inline functions. The _consteval_ specifier can only be used if the function mostly runs on compile-time for performance, however it cannot be evaluated at runtime. For today, some changes on the Gantt Chart was made as the transient simulation was not achieved.

My supervisor had advised to use the Armadillo library as a start for the project. I have started to test out the Armadillo library in VScode for C++. I have ran the code from [solarianprogrammer.com](https://solarianprogrammer.com/2017/03/24/getting-started-armadillo-cpp-linear-algebra-windows-mac-linux/) to test out the Armadillo library. The results are shown below:
