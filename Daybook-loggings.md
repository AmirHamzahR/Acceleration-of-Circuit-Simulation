# Developer's Logging for project's Daybook

## 21/9/2022

Today, I have learned and researched a few KLU libraries that would be useful to be used for the overall project. I have also asked my supervisor if the KLU libraries that
were discovered would be a good resource for the project.

Some resources from [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) was studied more thoroughly to improve my understandings on the latest C++ 20. Currently, I was trying to understand more how scope, duration and linkages work in the C++20 syntax. One important thing that was gained is that the nesting's maximum level should always be 3 for compound statements.

I continued learning more on [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) for declarations and inline functions. The _consteval_ specifier can only be used if the function mostly runs on compile-time for performance, however it cannot be evaluated at runtime. For today, some changes on the Gantt Chart was made as the transient simulation was not achieved.

My supervisor had advised to use the Armadillo library as a start for the project. I have started to test out the Armadillo library in VScode for C++. I have ran the code from [solarianprogrammer.com](https://solarianprogrammer.com/2017/03/24/getting-started-armadillo-cpp-linear-algebra-windows-mac-linux/) to test out the Armadillo library. The results are shown below:

The code ran perfectly with the 4x4 A matrix being generated by some random numbers and then being transposed. Then, the rows 1 and 3 are added while filling the 4th column with zeros. The B matrix is just the diagonal upmost left towards right of the A matrix while the other elements are filled with zero. This is called the diagonal matrix of A.

Tomorrow, I am planning to understand [arma sourceforge documents](http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#example_prog) more while translating some LU decomposition and Newton Raphson iterations from MATLAB to C++.

I have managed to create a code that test the LU decomposition and "solve' function from Armadillo library to solve x in Ax = b matrix equation.
The code runs well and could differentiate the lower and upper triangle of the matrix A. However, LU decomposition could not yet be used to solve the matrix equation. The results of the code is shown below:
